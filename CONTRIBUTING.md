# How to contribute

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Basic idea

Source + Doc + Test = :heart_eyes:

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to codonR](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonR/pull/new/master) with a 
clear description of what you have done. 
We suggest you follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). 
Please do not send us undocumented code as we might not accept it. Including tests to your pull request brings tears of joy to our eyes.  
 
The easier it is for us to review a pull request, the faster we will merge it. 

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you will get an idea of it:

  * We try to generally follow [R Google Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).
  * We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html) to document our code.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. 
  
Thank you,
codonPeople
