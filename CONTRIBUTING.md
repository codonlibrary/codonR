# How to contribute

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Basic idea

Source + Doc + Test = :heart_eyes:

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to codonR](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonR/pull/new/master) with a 
clear description of what you have done. 
We suggest you follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). 
Please do not send us undocumented code as we might not accept it. Including tests to your pull request brings tears of joy to our eyes.  
 
The easier it is for us to review a pull request, the faster we will merge it. 

## Coding conventions

We follow the [Tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/index) style guide which is predominantly used across the industry. The coding standards found within the Tidyverse style guide are **mandatory** when creating or modifying any code found within the R package.

The reason we follow Tidyverse coding standards is to ensure there is a layer of consistency across our codebase. This reduces the number of decisions that you need to make when styling your code, and also makes code easier to read when switching between functions etc.

While creating code we recommend that you understand the style guide standards for the following topics:

* [File structure](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html) â€“ Names, organisation, internal structure
* [Syntax](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html) â€“ Object names, spacing, argument names, code blocks, long lines, assignment, semicolons, quotes & comments
* [Functions]https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html â€“ Naming, long lines, return() & comments
* [Pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) â€“ Whitespace, long lines, short pipes, no arguments & assignment
* [Files](https://style.tidyverse.org/package-files.html) - Names
* [Documentation](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html) â€“ Title and description, indents and line breaks, documenting parameters, capitalization and full stops, cross-linking, R code, internal functions
* [Tests](https://style.tidyverse.org/tests.html) - Organisation
* [Error handling](https://style.tidyverse.org/error-messages.html) â€“ Problem statement, error location, hints, punctuation & before and after
  
Start reading our code to get a feel for it but most importantly, remember that this is open source software - consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

ðŸ¥‚ Thank you! Team codon
